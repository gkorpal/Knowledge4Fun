My HTML practice codes from my attempt to create a series of STEM websites during the year 2011. The websites were originally created and hosted using [Microsoft Office Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Live). It later lead to the creation of [my Wordpress blog](https://gaurish4math.wordpress.com/) (supported by ads).

I lost most of the source files. Here are some of the left over screen shots (click on them to see my first and the last attempt of using YouTube):
